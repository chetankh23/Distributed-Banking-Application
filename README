Programming Language Used -> Java

Implementation Details :-
1) Local branches have their server running on local machines.
2) Controller distributes initial amount of money depending on the number of branches.
3) After each and every branch has received initial amount of money, transactions are initiated.
4) A branch sends a random amount of money to random branch and maintains its own local balance.
5) After specific period of time, controller initiates the global snapshot algorithm by selecting a random branch.
6) Each branch records its local balance and incoming amount in transit from other branches.
6) Thereafter, controller retrieves the global snapshot data from every branch and displays it accordingly.


How to run :-
1) The file 'branches' contains details of branch name, ip and port number on which it is running.
2) Navigate to the project directory.
3) Run the make file.
4) Run ./branch.sh <branch_name> <port_number> as specified in 'branches' file. Run it for all branches.
5) The server of respective branches are up. So run the controller using ./controller.sh <amount_to_distribute> branches.
6) Make sure that the amount specified in controller is evenly distributed amongst all branches.
7) The controller will display the details of snapshot.


Sample Output

1) Branch :-

chetan@chetan-Lenovo-Yoga-3-14:~/eclipse_workspace/Distributed_Banking_Application$ ./branch.sh branch1 9091
Branch started on port 9091



2) Controller

chetan@chetan-Lenovo-Yoga-3-14:~/eclipse_workspace/Distributed_Banking_Application$ ./controller.sh 4000 branches
